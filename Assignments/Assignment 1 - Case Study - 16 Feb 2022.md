## Challenge

The vision of Free Bird is to bring in light into the lives of individuals trapped in the debt hell due to unorderly management of personal debts and institutional loans.

It aims to provide the necessary tools to

1. Educate and empower the aforementioned individuals
2. Help assess and plan their debt payoffs and become financially “free bird”.

There are some products in this arena but they lack the required amount of simplicity, flexibility, customizability, and insight to drive a common man towards becoming debt-free. This is the challenge Free Bird sets out to address.

## Strategy

1. A thorough analysis of the existing market players was made early on to understand their strengths and drawbacks and chalked out the way to address the existing shortcomings, one by one.

2. The technology stack was carefully chosen to be adaptable to the rapid evolution of the product without compromising the essentials like data structural integrity, content security, scalability combined and at the same time be as effective as possible with respect to maintenance costs.

3. Tracking of application usage patterns was essential to drive the product evolution hence the integration of analytics was made to start with.

```python
def calculateInterest (principal, interestRate, tenureInYears):return principal * interestRate * tenureInYears / 100
```

Tip: the above code snippet needs to be rendered in Python language mode

A clear pie chart of borrowings and lendings shows up at the very launch of the app to inform the user of his/her net financial position, along with the broken down view of the current month’s payables and receivables.

**Sharing is caring** - this becomes especially important when it comes to *financial matters*.
